/**
 * Single source of truth for the `view` axis on `/api/receiving-lines`.
 *
 * Both the API route handler (which branches its SQL `WHERE` on the view) and
 * the client table (which decides *which* view each display mode requests) MUST
 * import from here. Previously each side declared its own literal union; they
 * drifted — the server learned `activity`/`testing` while the client union
 * still capped out at `incoming`, so the client literally could not request the
 * view History needed. That drift is exactly what let "incoming orders" leak
 * into the History tab. Keep this list authoritative and let the compiler
 * enforce it on both ends.

/**
 * Every server-supported value of `?view=`.
 *
 * - `all`      — recent + received union; INCLUDES untouched-incoming EXPECTED
 *                rows. The broad bucket used by the Receive workspace.
 * - `recent`   — freshly scanned, not yet matched/received.
 * - `received` — physically in the warehouse (MATCHED → DONE).
 * - `incoming` — Zoho POs issued but not yet touched (EXPECTED, 0 received).
 * - `activity` — `all` minus untouched-incoming. The "what was actually
 *                scanned/unpacked" feed backing the History tab + recent rail.
 * - `scanned`  — door-scanned and physically in, but NOT yet unboxed
 *                (received_at set, unboxed_at null, nothing received on the
 *                line). The triage "to-do" between the door scan and the unbox
 *                step. Disjoint from `activity` (which requires qty>0 / unboxed).
 * - `testing`  — lines with at least one recorded testing verdict.
 * - `viewed`   — lines the requesting staff recently OPENED in the receiving
 *                workspace, newest-opened first. Per-staff, backed by
 *                receiving_line_views (upserted on open). Powers the unbox
 *                sidebar's "Viewed" pill.
